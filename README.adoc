= Lab | Description:

In this activity we are going to do some database maintenance. In the current database we only have information on movies for the year 2006. Now we have received the film catalog for 2020 as well. For this new data we will create another table and bulk insert all the data there. Code to create a new table has been provided below.

```sql
drop table if exists films_2020;
CREATE TABLE `films_2020` (
  `film_id` smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `title` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `description` text,
  `release_year` year(4) DEFAULT NULL,
  `language_id` tinyint(3) unsigned NOT NULL,
  `original_language_id` tinyint(3) unsigned DEFAULT NULL,
  `rental_duration` int(6),
  `rental_rate` decimal(4,2),
  `length` smallint(5) unsigned DEFAULT NULL,
  `replacement_cost` decimal(5,2) DEFAULT NULL,
  `rating` enum('G','PG','PG-13','R','NC-17') DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`film_id`),
  CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY (`original_language_id`) REFERENCES `language` (`language_id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=1003 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
```


We have just one item for each film, and all will be placed in the new table. For 2020, the rental duration will be 3 days, with an offer price of `2.99€` and a replacement cost of `8.99€` (these are all fixed values for all movies for this year). The catalog is in a CSV file named **films_2020.csv** that can be found at `files_for_lab` folder.

== Instructions

- Add the new films to the database.
- Update information on rental_duration, rental_rate, and replacement_cost.
== Hint

- You might have to use the following commands to set bulk import option to `ON`:

```sql
show variables like 'local_infile';
set global local_infile = 1;
```

- If bulk import gives an unexpected error, you can also use the `data_import_wizard` to insert data into the new table.



== Answer:
=== Cleaning the Data:
[.Data cleaning]
====
- [*] Verified Data Types: Checked the data types on the new table and on the data we have to load, to make sure they are compatible. I changed the data type of the "rating" colums from ENUM to VARCHAR(10) as there was an issue with a value being larger than the allowed by the ENUM type.

- [x] Dealing with NULL and empty fields: Replaced all the NULLS and empty fields by an "\N" which MySQL reads as NULL.

=== Creating the new `films_2020` table:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS films_2020;
CREATE TABLE `films_2020` (
  `film_id` smallint(5) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `title` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `description` text,
  `release_year` year(4) DEFAULT NULL,
  `language_id` tinyint(3) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
  `original_language_id` tinyint(3) UNSIGNED DEFAULT NULL,
  `rental_duration` int(6),
  `rental_rate` decimal(4, 2),
  `length` smallint(5) UNSIGNED DEFAULT NULL,
  `replacement_cost` decimal(5, 2) DEFAULT NULL,
  `rating` varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`film_id`),
  CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY (`original_language_id`) REFERENCES `language` (`language_id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE
) ENGINE = InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT = 1003 DEFAULT CHARSET = utf8;
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'local_infile';
```

=== Setting the bulk import option to ON:
```sql
SET
  GLOBAL local_infile = 1;
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'local_infile';
```

=== Finding the MySQL secure upload folder:

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES
WHERE
  variable_name = 'secure_file_priv';
```

===  Loading the data:
```sql

LOAD data INFILE '/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/films_2020.csv' 
INTO TABLE films_2020 FIELDS TERMINATED by ',' 
LINES TERMINATED by '\n' 
IGNORE 1 LINES;

```

=== Update information on `rental_duration`, `rental_rate`, and `replacement_cost`

```sql
UPDATE
  films_2020
SET
  rental_duration = (3),
  rental_rate = (2.99),
  replacement_cost = (8.99);

```

==== Checking that the data was updated:
```sql
SELECT
  rental_duration,
  rental_rate,
  replacement_cost
FROM
  films_2020
LIMIT
  5;
```
